## What Problem Does It Solve?

Writing commercial and technical proposals is a **time-consuming, repetitive process** that involves:

- Researching the prospective client (company profile, key decision-makers, industry context)
- Analyzing RFP documents to extract requirements, budget constraints, and evaluation criteria
- Searching internal records for relevant past projects and case studies
- Estimating costs based on team composition, complexity, and project scope
- Writing a structured, professional proposal that ties everything together

This system **automates the entire pipeline** — from client research to final deliverable — by coordinating four specialized AI agents through a single conversational interface. What traditionally takes days of manual work is reduced to a single interactive session.

---

## Architecture

The system follows an **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** pattern where a central orchestrator powered by Claude coordinates four independent agents, each running as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server.

```
                         ┌─────────────────────────────┐
                         │        User (CLI Chat)       │
                         └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                        │
                                        ▼
                         ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                         │   Orchestrator (Claude LLM)  │
                         │   A2A Coordination Engine     │
                         │   Agentic Loop (max 10 iter) │
                         └──┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───┘
                            │       │       │       │
                  ┌─────────▼──┐ ┌──▼─────┐ ┌▼──────┐ ┌▼────────┐
                  │  Client    │ │Knowledge│ │Proposal│ │ Pricing │
                  │  Research  │ │  Base   │ │ Writer │ │  Agent  │
                  │  Agent     │ │  Agent  │ │ Agent  │ │         │
                  │ (MCP Srv)  │ │(MCP Srv)│ │(MCP Sv)│ │(MCP Srv)│
                  └────────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘ └─────────┘
```

### How It Works

1. The user submits a request through the **interactive CLI** (e.g., _"Create a proposal for Acme Corp for a mobile app project"_)
2. The **Orchestrator** analyzes the request using Claude and determines which agents and tools to invoke
3. Agents are called via **MCP tool execution** — each agent runs as a subprocess communicating over stdio
4. The orchestrator loops (up to 10 iterations), calling tools and accumulating context until Claude produces a final synthesized response
5. The user receives a **complete, professional proposal** ready for client submission
6. Optionally, the proposal is **exported to a .docx file** with cover page, branding, and professional formatting

---

## Agent Cards (A2A Discovery)

The system uses **Agent Cards** to implement the A2A discovery pattern. Each agent publishes a card (defined via Pydantic models in [agent_cards.py](orchestrator/agent_cards.py)) that declares its identity, capabilities, and how to start it. The orchestrator reads these cards at runtime to discover available agents and route tasks.

```python
class AgentCard(BaseModel):
    agent_id: str           # Unique identifier (e.g., "client_research")
    name: str               # Human-readable name
    description: str        # What the agent does
    version: str            # Semantic version
    status: AgentStatus     # available | busy | offline
    skills: list[AgentSkill]        # List of capabilities with MCP tool mappings
    mcp_server_command: list[str]   # Command to launch the MCP server subprocess
    dependencies: list[str]         # Other agent IDs this agent depends on
```

Each **AgentSkill** maps a high-level capability to a specific MCP tool and includes example queries that help the orchestrator understand when to invoke it:

| Agent Card | Skills | Dependencies |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| `client_research` | `company_research`, `rfp_analysis`, `linkedin_research` | — |
| `knowledge_base` | `project_search`, `project_details`, `tech_stack_search`, `case_studies` | — |
| `proposal_writer` | `full_proposal`, `timeline`, `executive_summary`, `export_docx` | `client_research`, `knowledge_base` |
| `pricing` | `project_estimation`, `custom_estimation`, `rate_card` | — |

All cards are registered in `AGENT_REGISTRY`, making it easy to add new agents — just define a new `AgentCard` and register it.

## Example Usage

```
> Research Acme Corp and create a proposal for a mobile e-commerce app

[Orchestrator calls Client Research Agent → searches company info]
[Orchestrator calls Knowledge Base Agent → finds similar past projects]
[Orchestrator calls Pricing Agent → estimates project cost]
[Orchestrator calls Proposal Writer Agent → generates full proposal]

✅ Complete 8-section proposal generated with:
   - Company analysis and context
   - Technical solution architecture
   - Relevant case studies from past projects
   - Detailed cost breakdown and timeline
   - Executive summary and next steps

> Export the proposal to Word

[Proposal Writer Agent → exports to DOCX]

✅ Saved to exports/proposal_acme_corp_20260207_143022.docx
```

## Key Design Decisions

- **MCP over REST**: Agents communicate via stdio-based MCP rather than HTTP, eliminating network overhead and simplifying local deployment
- **Agentic loop**: The orchestrator lets Claude decide which tools to call and in what order, enabling flexible multi-step reasoning
- **Bilingual support**: Proposals can be generated in English or Spanish via a simple language parameter
- **Configurable pricing**: Rate cards, complexity multipliers, and discount tiers are stored in JSON files for easy customization without code changes
- **DOCX export**: Proposals can be exported to professional Word documents with cover page, branded styling, headers/footers, and page numbers via `python-docx`
- **Agent Cards (A2A discovery)**: Each agent publishes a structured card declaring its skills, MCP tool mappings, and dependencies, enabling dynamic discovery and extensibility
- **Modular agents**: Each agent is fully independent and can be developed, tested, or replaced without affecting the rest of the system
